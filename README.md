## NOTE

At present this module is requires a working kubernetes cluster, with kubectl installed.
In addition to this it is recommended that a service account be setup in the desired namespace
before installation of helm to use full functionatlity.

## Description

The helm module installs, configures and manages the helm package manager.

This module manages both the installation of the helm client and helm server. In addition to this it will manage helm deployments

## Setup

To install with the default options:
`include helm`

## Usage

To customise options, such as the version of helm, or the service account and namespace of the tiller deployment:

```
class { 'helm':
  version => '2.6.0',
  service_account => 'my_account',
  tiller_namespace => 'my_namespace',
}
```

### Contributing

[Puppet][] modules on the [Puppet Forge][] are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canâ€™t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to make it as easy as possible to contribute changes so our modules work in your environment, but we also need contributors to follow a few guidelines to help us maintain and improve the modules' quality.

For more information, please read the complete [module contribution guide][] and check out [CONTRIBUTING.md][].
